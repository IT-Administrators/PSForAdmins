Here you will find basic linux commands like cut, converted to powershell, to make them available on windows. 

Not every part of each linux command is translated to powershell but the most used ones. 

Every linux command is provided as a script and module, that implements a function. Use <Get-Help FunctionName -Full>, to get a comment based help on every function.

The converted linux commands are following the syntax, "Invoke-LinuxCommand" like Invoke-Cut.

Feel free to contribute with tips, scripts or even modules.
